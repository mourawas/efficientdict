# Efficient dictionary sorting and anagram finder

This is a single-file C++ program created in **2021** that focuses on efficient dictionary-based word processing.

The program uses a **binary insertion sort** algorithm, which combines insertion sort with binary search to efficiently find the correct position for each word.    
This ensures that the dictionary is sorted for quick lookups and comparisons.    
Finds anagrams by transforming words into a standardized "alphabetical signature" (e.g., `CAT` becomes `ACT`) to detect anagrams quickly and accurately.
Ensures input integrity and handles edge cases.
